- [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)

## Getting Started Steps

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install essential packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. First AI-Assisted Project
1. Choose a simple project idea
2. Set up your development environment
3. Start with a basic prompt
4. Iterate and refine with AI assistance

### 3. Best Practices
- Start with clear requirements
- Break down complex tasks
- Use AI for:
  - Code generation
  - Code review
  - Documentation
  - Testing
  - Debugging

## Prompt Engineering Basics
