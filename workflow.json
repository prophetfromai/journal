{"workflow":"<think>\nOkay, I need to create a simple \"Hello World\" function in Python that prints to the console. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that in Python, functions are defined using the def keyword. So I'll start by writing `def hello_world():`. This sets up the basic structure of the function.\n\nNext, inside the function, I need to print \"Hello, World!\". The simplest way to do this is by using the print() function. So I'll add `print(\"Hello, World!\")` after the colon inside the function. That should display the message when the function runs.\n\nI also want the function to execute automatically when it's called. So I'll include a return statement before the closing parenthesis of the function definition. The return statement here is just returning None since the print statement already does the output.\n\nPutting it all together, the function will look like this:\n- Define the function with def.\n- Add the print statement inside.\n- Return None to execute the print command when the function is called.\n\nI should test this by calling `hello_world()` in the console. If it works, the message should appear as expected. I don't think there are any constraints beyond that, so this should be a straightforward solution.\n</think>\n\nTo create and run a simple \"Hello World\" function in Python:\n\n1. **Define the Function**: Use the `def` keyword to create a new function named `hello_world`.\n\n2. **Add the Print Statement**: Inside the function, call the built-in `print()` function with the string \"Hello, World!\".\n\n3. **Return None**: The function automatically executes the print statement when called, so add a `return None` statement.\n\nHere's the complete code:\n\n```python\ndef hello_world():\n    print(\"Hello, World!\")\n    return None\n\n# Execute the function\nhello_world()\n```\n\nWhen you call `hello_world()`, it will print \"Hello, World!\" to your console.","id":"2d457f43-7e8d-404b-9d82-3a4db5b35a29"}
